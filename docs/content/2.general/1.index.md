## Integrations

The integration of Alokai (formerly known as Vuestorefront) with Odoo creates a powerful and flexible e-commerce solution, combining the modernity of a headless frontend with the robustness of a comprehensive ERP system. This integration also incorporates Redis and Algolia for performance optimization and advanced search capabilities. This document serves as a guide for implementing this integration, facilitating the creation of online stores that benefit from the scalability, customization, and performance offered by these platforms.

**Alokai**: A modern frontend framework built with Vue.js, designed to create Progressive Web Applications (PWA) for e-commerce. Its headless architecture allows for a complete separation between frontend and backend, providing flexibility in backend choice and implementation.

**Odoo**: An open-source ERP system that covers a wide range of business functionalities, including CRM, sales, inventory, accounting, e-commerce, and more. Odoo provides a GraphQL API that enables efficient interactions between the frontend and backend, making it ideal for integrations with platforms like Alokai.

**Redis**: An in-memory database used to enhance application performance and scalability. In the context of this integration, Redis is employed for data caching, session management, and optimizing read and write operations, reducing backend load and speeding up response times.

**Algolia**: A search and discovery platform that provides real-time search results and advanced filtering. Algolia is integrated to offer fast and relevant search capabilities on the frontend, with instant and customizable results. It allows for efficient indexing and searching of data such as products and categories.
Objective of the Integration

The integration between Alokai and Odoo aims to deliver an optimized online shopping experience, where the frontend provides a fast and responsive user interface, while the Odoo backend manages critical data such as products, inventory, orders, and customers. Redis and Algolia are used to ensure high performance, with fast responses and advanced search functionalities.
Key Components of the Integration

### API Layer

Communication between Alokai and Odoo is handled via API, using GraphQL for GET requests (queries) and mutations for other operations (POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Custom Types and Responses

On the client side, the responses for queries and mutations are typed to ensure consistency and avoid errors during development.

Modular Structure: The code is organized in a modular fashion, with queries and mutations registered in their respective directories, allowing for easy maintenance and extensibility.
Redis Caching: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, managing sessions, and optimizing performance, ensuring a fast and efficient response.
Algolia Search: Algolia is integrated to provide real-time search and advanced filtering, enhancing the search experience on the frontend and allowing for quick and relevant results.

### Benefits of the Integration

Performance: Alokai's PWA architecture ensures customers experience fast loading times and a smooth shopping experience. The use of Redis and Algolia further optimizes performance and search, reducing backend load and speeding up response times.
Flexibility: The separation between frontend and backend allows for independent customizations and upgrades, making it easier to adapt to new trends and technologies.
Scalability: With Odoo managing critical backend operations, Redis improving performance, and Algolia optimizing search, the solution can scale with the business, handling increased order volumes, products, and users effectively.
