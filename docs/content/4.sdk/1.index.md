## Example Usage

The following api is about to load a cart using LoadCart odoo query.

```ts
const { $sdk } = useNuxtApp();
const cart = useState<Cart>('cart', () => ({} as Cart));

const loadCart = async () => {
  const { data } = await $sdk().odoo.query<null, CartResponse>({
    queryName: QueryName.LoadCartQuery,
  });

  cart.value = data.value.cart;
};
```

The odoo query

```json
 query {
    cart {
      order {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
```

This query doesnt requires parameters, thats why the first parameter passed to sdk qury api is null:

```ts
$sdk().odoo.query<null, CartResponse>;
```

The first sdk param is the query param, the second is the query response. You can realize that the second parameter is a type. So, first of all, you nedd to create this type at client side.
The types file you can find at /graphql directory.

```ts
export type CartResponse = AsyncData<
  {
    cart: Cart;
  },
  H3Error
>;
```

To create the types on client side you need run the query or mutation on graphiQl first and then check what is returned. Take a look:

```ts
{
  "data": {
    "cart": {
      "order": {
        "id": 280,
        "name": "S00280"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Above is the return from loadCart query. This is an object caled data with a Cart odoo type inside.
